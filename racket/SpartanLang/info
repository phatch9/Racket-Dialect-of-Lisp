Develop an interpreter for a small language, called SpartanLang.
The valid expressions for SpartanLang are given in Figure 1
SpartanLang supports mutable references.
The state of these references is maintained in an environment, a mapping of variables to values.
With mutable references, other language constructs become more useful,such as sequencing operations (e1;e2).
